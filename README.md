## DESCRIPTION

I've always enjoyed working with colors and finding new inspiration for color palettes. This app's purpose is to provide such inspiration!

Currently, it supports generation of a three-color split complementary scheme. It is based on the generation of a single primary color. Secondary colors are generated by adding and subtracting from the generated hue.

## FUTURE PLANS

I plan to support other types of color schemes in the future. I would also like to generate a list of variations for each color that is generated.
